# Meta Ad Performance Dashboard | Power BI Marketing Analytics

## Project Overview
The Meta Ad Performance Dashboard is a business intelligence solution built in Power BI to evaluate advertising effectiveness across Facebook and Instagram. Using event-level data (~400,000+ records), the dashboard analyzes the complete marketing funnel — from impressions and engagement to conversions and purchases — enabling marketing teams to optimize campaign performance, budget allocation, and ROI.

## Business Objective
The objective of this project is to provide marketing teams with clear visibility into campaign performance and ROI by:

- Analyzing audience behavior and ad creative effectiveness
- Supporting data-driven budget allocation and optimization
